#### Password

:   Specifies the password required to authenticate with the proxy server, if applicable.

### Connection Authentication

#### User ID

:   Unique identifier used to authenticate with the Blender website for downloading builds. Generated automatically if not set.

#### GitHub Token

:   Optional GitHub Personal Access Token to avoid rate limiting when checking for launcher updates and fetching API data.
    
:   For detailed instructions on creating and configuring a GitHub token, see the [GitHub Token](github_token.md) page.

!!! tip
    Without a token, GitHub limits requests to 60 per hour. With a token, you get 5,000 requests per hour.

## Blender Builds

![Blender Builds page of Settings](imgs/settings_window_blenderbuilds.png)

### Visibility and Downloading

: Choose the visibility and build downloading for different Blender branches and repositories.

#### Eye

- Show / Hide Library tab (Also removes the link download tab)

#### Download

- Enable / Disable the scraping of builds. 
  
    !!! Info
        This helps reduce the number of requests the Blender Launcher creates on the Blender server for builds the user doesn't use.

### Checking For Builds

#### Check Automatically

:   Automatically check if a new build has been released and send a notification if there is a new one available.

#### On Startup

:   If Blender launcher will check for a new build when launched.

#### Min Stable Build to Scrape

:   Set the minimum Blender version to scrape; this reduces the request amount and speeds up the build gathering time.

#### Scrape Stable Builds

:   If the Blender Launcher will gather the Stable build, disabling this will speed up the gathering of the daily build.

#### Scrape Automated Builds

:   If the Blender Launcher will gather the automated daily build (daily, experimental, patch).

### Downloading & Saving build

Actions that will be performed on newly added builds to Library tab right after downloading is finished.

#### Mark As Favorite

:   Mark every newly added build to the Library tab as favorite depending on the branch type.

#### Install Template

:   Installs a template on newly added builds to the Library tab.

### Launching Builds

#### Quick Launch Global SHC

:   Launches builds added to quick launch via a user-defined key sequence.

#### Hide Console On Startup

!!! info
    This only works on Windows.

:   Launch Blender via `blender-launcher.exe` to hide the console on startup. Works on Blender version 3.0 and higher.

    !!! warning "Known Issues"

        When using this feature, the number of running instances will not be shown.

#### Startup Arguments

:   Adds specific instructions as if Blender were launching from the command line (after the blender executable i.e. `blender [args …]`).

:   For example, the `-W` (force opening Blender in fullscreen mode) argument internally will produce the following command:

    ```
    %path to blender executable% -W
    ```

:   List of commands can be found on Blender manual [Command Line Arguments](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/advanced/command_line/arguments.html) page.

#### Bash Arguments

!!! info
    This only works on Linux.

:   Adds specific instructions as if Blender were launching from the command line (before the blender executable i.e. `[args …] blender`).

:   For example, `env __NV_PRIME_RENDER_OFFLOAD=1 __GLX_VENDOR_LIBRARY_NAME=nvidia` (force Blender to use a dedicated graphics card) arguments internally will produce the following command:

    ```
    env __NV_PRIME_RENDER_OFFLOAD=1 __GLX_VENDOR_LIBRARY_NAME=nvidia nohup %path to blender executable% %startup arguments%
    ```
#### Record Bash Output Using Nohup 

!!! info
    This only works on Linux.

:   Determines whether or not to place '"nohup" in front of everything placed in front of the blender executable.

:   If turned off, the example above will instead produce this command:
    
    ```
    env __NV_PRIME_RENDER_OFFLOAD=1 __GLX_VENDOR_LIBRARY_NAME=nvidia %path to blender executable% %startup arguments%
    ```
